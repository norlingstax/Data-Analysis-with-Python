# Data-Analysis-with-Python

I've earned the certification of this course (Data Analysis with Python). [You can verify it on this page.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/vanastasia/data-analysis-with-python-v7)

This repository contains my solutions to challenges from the freeCodeCAmp Data Analysis with Python course, highlighting skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn:

1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**  
   Developed a function to calculate and return key statistics—mean, variance, standard deviation, min, max, and sum—across rows, columns, and the entire 3x3 matrix. This project used NumPy and focused on matrix manipulations and error handling to ensure robust functionality.

2. **Demographic Data Analyzer**  
   Analyzed demographic data extracted from the 1994 Census database using Pandas. Key insights included the percentage of individuals with advanced education earning >50K, the most popular occupation for high earners in India, and other population statistics. This project emphasized data querying and aggregations to extract meaningful information.

3. **Medical Data Visualizer**  
   Visualized and analyzed medical examination data to explore relationships between cardiac disease and various health indicators such as cholesterol, glucose levels, and lifestyle factors. Created categorical plots and heatmaps using Seaborn to provide actionable insights into health outcomes.

4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**  
   Designed multiple visualizations, including a line chart, bar chart, and box plots, to analyse forum page views from 2016 to 2019. This project highlighted time-series analysis, data filtering, and visualization techniques to uncover trends and seasonal patterns in page views.

5. **Sea Level Predictor**  
   Analyzed historical sea level data to predict future sea level changes through 2050. Created scatter plots and linear regression models to visualize and forecast trends. This project combined statistical analysis with data visualization to emphasize the impacts of climate change.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Strengthened data analysis skills using Pandas for data manipulation and querying.  
- Developed robust visualization techniques with Matplotlib and Seaborn to effectively communicate insights.  
- Gained experience in working with real-world datasets, focusing on diverse challenges such as demographic analysis, time-series visualization, and predictive modeling.
